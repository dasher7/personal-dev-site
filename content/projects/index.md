In terms of work-related projects, I've worked on different types of projects.
Starting from financial services, to energetic or grocery and stores.

But those are not the only projects I've been working on.
Of course, I had my own little fun. Here a list of projects I built/I've been building.
Some of them are real project, others are more a showcase or a try-it-out sort-of-boilerplate - always useful - projects.

- [RealTime ingestor engine for BigData](https://github.com/dasher7/spark-rest-ingestor) : It's built in Spark, an apache technology which as a great capability in managing tons of data per second. The project uses MongoDB as a database in which store data. It also support Hadoop file system, from which he can read and write files. It's based on Spring Boot, with a few APIs that handles all the flow, a useful Swagger is provided.

- [Taskify](https://github.com/dasher7/task-calendar-organizer) : This project is related to a course I had to create for new entries in my old job. It was built to showcase the basic features of React and how to integrate a framework, which in this case i Grommet V2.0.

- [Shelfify](https://github.com/dasher7/shelfify) : This project is the natural evolution of Taskify. As an organized person, I'd like to memo and save-to-a-safe-and-handy place things I've watched, read, played. It's a little and easy to use digital library in which you can store whatever you want. Built in React and Grommet v2.0 with Firebase as a service.

- [GraphQL and Java: a love story](https://github.com/dasher7/graphql-bootstrap): GraphQL, as a lover of API design, to me, was love at first sight. But when it comes to integrate with pure Java, it's a pain in the neck. That's a basic bootstrap that may come in handy, but i warn you: don't you dare use GraphQL with Java. Please, dont't.

- [WebFLux and the future](https://github.com/dasher7/webflux-api): WebFlux was a huge surprise to me. It's finding is related to the realtime engine I was building. I had to show in realtime what was going on into the database. A file got saved? A file must be shown to the user. And there is WebFlux. A huge thanks to Spring Boot to always simplify my life.
