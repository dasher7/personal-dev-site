### Contacts

I am a pretty social guy, basically you can find me on most of the social networks.

Firts of all, you should know that one of my passion is writing.
Therefore, i created [Tybearder](https://tybearder.com/) , a personal place where I can share my stories.
You eventually may find them on Medium, as listed below, but having my little intimate space in this crowded world, matters to me.
