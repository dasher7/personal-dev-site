### Skills

As you may have guessed by my bio, I am pretty a curios guy. That's why I like wandering through many languages.
Lucky, in my so short-not-so-short carrier, I've been through a lot of different duties.
Mainly backend sort of issue, I've stepped my feet onto the ground of the foggy mysterious front-end field.
Also went on a pleasure trip in the sea of whales, passing through a lot of clouds.
But let's keep thing short and straight, that's what I know.

| Language or Software | Knowledge |
| -------------------- | --------- |
| Java                 | 90%       |
| Spring Boot          | 90%       |
| JavaScript           | 85%       |
| React                | 90%       |
| Node                 | 70%       |
| Docker               | 70%       |
