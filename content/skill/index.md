### Skills

As you may have guessed by my bio, I am pretty a curios guy. That's why I like wandering through many languages.
Lucky, in my so short-not-so-short carrier, I've been through a lot of different duties.
Mainly backend sort of issue, I've stepped my feet onto the ground of the foggy mysterious front-end field.
Also went on a pleasure trip in the sea of whales, passing through a lot of clouds.
But let's keep thing short and straight, that's what I know.

| Language or Software | Knowledge |
| -------------------- | --------- |
| Java                 | 90%       |
| Spring Boot          | 90%       |
| JavaScript           | 85%       |
| React                | 90%       |
| Node                 | 70%       |
| Docker               | 65%       |
| SQL                  | 80%       |
| GraphQL              | 70%       |
| Firebase             | 60%       |

As regarding of software and tools, you know, there are plenty out there.
As dev tools related to personal and professionals projects, I used lots of Apache product.
As software, VS Code is my fav text editor, as IDE IntelliJ over Eclipse for its flexibility and reliability.
Alongside, console of all types, Postman, Git, various SQL clients, so many chrome extensions, you know the drill.
