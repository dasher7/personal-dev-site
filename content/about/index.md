### About Andrea

Hello, World!
I am Andrea.

That's an always funny and neverending joke all devs like to sat, a clichè.
I am 26 year old guy from the north of Italy, Como, to be more precise.
I got a degree in computer science at the Università degli Studi di Milano in the early 2018.
From that point on, guess what, I started working as developer. Actually, I've been working since before that day.

"But, are you front-end or back-end dev?"
I've got asked this question so many times, and the answer is always the same.
I am a developer, and being a developer means face problem, analyze them, put a straight strategy to solve them, test and, if you lucky enough, solve it.
Of course, there are so many areas as a dev, and all of them require some sort of mindset, but the fundamentals are those.

I am mainly a backend developer, if you desperatly wanna know, a nerdy API designer.
But I've been through a lot of front-end stuff. Also I had to face docker, which I think is awesome, and data manipulation.

As regarding me as a person, you may have guessed I am a true fun of minimalism. I am a practical and organized person, always curios to find and try new things: discovery is growth.

I a have mainly three passions: videogames, travel and reading.
