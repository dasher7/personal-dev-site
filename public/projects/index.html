Starting from financial services, to energetic or grocery and stores.</p>
<p>But those are not the only projects I&rsquo;ve been working on.
Of course, I had my own little fun. Here a list of projects I built/I&rsquo;ve been building.
Some of them are real project, others are more a showcase or a try-it-out sort-of-boilerplate - always useful - projects.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dasher7/spark-rest-ingestor">RealTime ingestor engine for BigData</a> : It&rsquo;s built in Spark, an apache technology which as a great capability in managing tons of data per second. The project uses MongoDB as a database in which store data. It also support Hadoop file system, from which he can read and write files. It&rsquo;s based on Spring Boot, with a few APIs that handles all the flow, a useful Swagger is provided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dasher7/task-calendar-organizer">Taskify</a> : This project is related to a course I had to create for new entries in my old job. It was built to showcase the basic features of React and how to integrate a framework, which in this case i Grommet V2.0.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dasher7/shelfify">Shelfify</a> : This project is the natural evolution of Taskify. As an organized person, I&rsquo;d like to memo and save-to-a-safe-and-handy place things I&rsquo;ve watched, read, played. It&rsquo;s a little and easy to use digital library in which you can store whatever you want. Built in React and Grommet v2.0 with Firebase as a service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dasher7/graphql-bootstrap">GraphQL and Java: a love story</a>: GraphQL, as a lover of API design, to me, was love at first sight. But when it comes to integrate with pure Java, it&rsquo;s a pain in the neck. That&rsquo;s a basic bootstrap that may come in handy, but i warn you: don&rsquo;t you dare use GraphQL with Java. Please, dont&rsquo;t.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dasher7/webflux-api">WebFLux and the future</a>: WebFlux was a huge surprise to me. It&rsquo;s finding is related to the realtime engine I was building. I had to show in realtime what was going on into the database. A file got saved? A file must be shown to the user. And there is WebFlux. A huge thanks to Spring Boot to always simplify my life.</p>
