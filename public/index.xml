      <description>In terms of work-related projects, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on different types of projects. Starting from financial services, to energetic or grocery and stores.
But those are not the only projects I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on. Of course, I had my own little fun. Here a list of projects I built/I&amp;rsquo;ve been building. Some of them are real project, others are more a showcase or a try-it-out sort-of-boilerplate - always useful - projects.</description>

      <description>About Andrea Hello, World! I am Andrea.
That&amp;rsquo;s an always funny and neverending joke all devs like to sat, a clichè. I am 26 year old guy from the north of Italy, Como, to be more precise. I got a degree in computer science at the Università degli Studi di Milano in the early 2018. From that point on, guess what, I started working as developer. Actually, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working since before that day.</description>

      <description>Skills As you may have guessed by my bio, I am pretty a curios guy. That&amp;rsquo;s why I like wandering through many languages. Lucky, in my so short-not-so-short carrier, I&amp;rsquo;ve been through a lot of different duties. Mainly backend sort of issue, I&amp;rsquo;ve stepped my feet onto the ground of the foggy mysterious front-end field. Also went on a pleasure trip in the sea of whales, passing through a lot of clouds.</description>
